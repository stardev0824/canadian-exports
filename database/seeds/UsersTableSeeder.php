When the contract was almost cancelled, Hugh turned the potential loss into an opportunity.   It was when the national retailer who sold the racks couldn&rsquo;t find a supplier to make the cotton straps usedto fasten the racks to car roofs that Hugh realized with the right set-up it would be easy to make the straps.   The customer would be serviced, the contract would be saved, and the product - the only one of its kind at the time - would continue to reach the market.   In 1971 H.D. Brown Enterprises Ltd. began operations as a small cut and sew business with two staff working out of a factory in St. George, Ontario. Over the years the furniture business was sold and H.D.

John had apprenticed in Germany, and had a superb combination of electrical and mechanical skills. During this time he played a key role in the design of the Amalgamated Rotary handle switch from 30 Amperes to 1200 Amperes. This basic design is still manufactured today.  John had gone to work for Westinghouse as the head of a assembly shop to offer control panels and custom distribution equipment to local contractors. The shop was burdened by high overheads artificially imposed by the company and therefore appeared to Westinghouse to be unprofitable, in an accounting sense.</p>','company_name' => 'Indus Automation Inc.','company_email' => 'info@indusautomation.com','address' => '460 Higgins Ave.','url' => 'www.indusautomation.com','phone' => '+1 (204) 943-0050','fax' => '+1 (204) 943-0112','key_words' => '','logo' => '144.jpeg','video' => '','facebook' => NULL,'twitter' => NULL,'linked_in' => NULL,'youtube' => NULL,'google' => NULL,'image_1' => NULL,'image_2' => NULL,'image_3' => NULL,'image_4' => NULL),

In addition, shea butter has natural sunscreen properties and anti-inflammatory agents. Because of its amazing properties, shea butter is an excellent ingredient for soaps, lotions and creams. Perhaps it is most effective when applied to the skin in its pure state. Regular users of pure, unrefined shea butter notice softer, smoother, healthier skin.

<p style="text-align: justify">When I was a child, Arthur Brock, my&nbsp; &quot;favorite uncle&quot;, operated a general store that his grandfather had founded.&nbsp; He enjoyed a high degree of independence in his job and I liked that.&nbsp; It made me want to start my own business.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In the early 1970s I was closing in on 30, and impatient to do something on my own. I had a degree in chemistry and a few years experience selling gas chromatography equipment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The commercial development of gas chromatography in the early \'60s was revolutionizing analytical chemistry, and at the same time, the publication of Rachel Carson\'s seminal book, &quot;Silent Spring&quot; had made society realize that nature was vulnerable to human intervention.&nbsp; She was talking about the indiscriminant use of DDT but the question soon became &quot;what contaminants are in the natural environment and food - and what harm are they doing to us?&quot;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">To get at that question, GC had become the analytical technique of choice, and it turned out that trace levels of contaminants were everywhere - including in the organic solvents that were available from laboratory supply houses at the time.&nbsp; This led to analysts distilling 4, 8, and even 20 litre batches of flammable solvents in glass vessels with electric heating mantles on their lab bench, to try to get the pure solvents they needed to avoid masking the contaminants of interest.&nbsp; I thought that was pretty inefficient and hazardous too.&nbsp; But I had my opportunity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">There\'s an old story about Caledon having been started in a garden shed.&nbsp; That is only partly true.&nbsp; Mary Lou and I lived in a wooden house that was one hundred years old and we had two small children.&nbsp; I wasn\'t about to take the risk* of distilling anything in the cellar, so the garden shed was used for a series of small scale batches to see if I could get the required purity.&nbsp; The first real production occurred in the fall of 1972 in a 1,500 square foot building on rented land.&nbsp; By 1975 we had acquired industrial land in Georgetown and moved to a 4,500 square foot plant that was custom designed for the purification and packaging of organic solvents.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">So that\'s where we came from.&nbsp; How we got there is a story of taking one step at a time.&nbsp; As we refined our methods we added more solvents, and then chemicals, and then acids and solutions, and the plant was expanded again to the 24,000 square feet that we now occupy.&nbsp; But more important than those size and product additions are the people who took the steps to make the expansions happen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">I have always believed that if you treat people well, they will treat you well in return.&nbsp; It is a simple truth that, in business, applies to customers, suppliers and employees.&nbsp; Early on, Caledon adopted and clearly communicated some core policies, a central one being to treat people with dignity and trust.&nbsp; Then, by their actions, the company and its managers did their utmost to give those policies substance.&nbsp; For more on this click on Management Philosophy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Caledon employees have responded in spades.&nbsp; The whole group - Sales and Customer Service, Marketing, Purchasing, Production, Accounting and Distribution - operates as a coordinated team in which individuals contribute that &quot;discretionary effort&quot; that we all have within ourselves, and can make available when we are motivated to do so.&nbsp; That is how we got here.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">And what of my favorite Uncle Arthur? He lived a long and productive life, and the store is now run by two of his grandchildren - the fifth generation of Brocks to do so.&nbsp; It is a fixture on the main street of Port Perry, Ontario, and is about to celebrate its 125th anniversary.</p>

This initial endeavor expanded first to systems for paint and varnish curing, then to ovens for the stress relieving of springs, and eventually to the tempering of hardened parts. Pyromaitre\'s current development emphasis is on turn-key system solutions for the warm setting of springs. Pyromaitre established it\'s market position with the development and commercialization of the high-speed stress relieving process. Approved in 1997 by GM for valve springs, the &quot;Pyro Process&quot; is the acknowledged industry standard for precision automotive springs. The &quot;Pyro Process&quot; was successfully expanded to tempering applications and approved in 1999 by Ford for CV Joints, Axle Shafts, and Transmission Gears. The acceleration in acceptance of high-speed tempering continues to define our growth.</span></p>

<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &quot;Century Gothic&quot;; color: black;">Today, Pyromaitre is a global manufacturer of high-precision industrial ovens for tempering, stress relieving, hot setting, warm forming, and paint curing. Our unique designs and process expertise has driven our growth into one of the premier global manufacturers of thermal processing equipment.</span>','company_name' => 'Pyromaitre Inc.','company_email' => 'pyro@pyromaitre.com','address' => '1081, ch.

By installing packers on the back of cultivators, K-Hart gave farmers an inexpensive alternative for direct seeding rather than the large investment in the purchase of an air drill. Our packer system has a unique packer design with one of the largest selections of various packer wheels of any manufacturer. We introduced coulters and fertilizer banders to the K-Hart product line in 1994. K-Hart recognized the fact that with knife openers on zero till air drills, there was only a limited amount of fertilizer could be placed with the seed and with our coulters and fertilizer banders, additional fertilizer could be placed safely well away from the seed.<o:p></o:p></p>

Glenn Kellett saw an opportunity to provide a service initially to the municipal utilities market. Glenn went out and purchased his first truck, an early 1950s International Truck, with a Buick engine and an old &ldquo;A-Frame&rdquo; Derrick Mounted on it. The Truck was well used, but it was affordable enough to help start the business. Bringing twenty years of hands on experience, Glenn incorporated the Company and established the first office in the basement of his Scarborough home &ndash; where the company began to quickly excel.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

KBC began as a catalog house selling surplus and English tools to the metalworking industry at a discount. Its motto became &ldquo;We Will Not Be Undersold,&rdquo; and it still is. KBC&rsquo;s original home was 1,000 square feet of rental space on Eight Mile Road, right next to a Top Hat Hamburger Drive Thru, a Detroit tradition. For the next three years, Karel commuted back and forth from London, England to Detroit, Michigan. Then, in 1968 with business growing, he hired John Earles as Vice-President and decided that it was time to move to the Motor City permanently with his wife Sheila and daughter Paula. Shortly after, KBC moved further up Eight Mile Road to more spacious and glamorous digs.</span></p>

But most important to the company&rsquo;s success are its clients, to whom it owes a sincere &lsquo;thank you.&rsquo; Many customers have been doing business with KBC for so long that we know them by voice when they call, despite having never met them in person!

<br />
As his business grew he made a decision to move to Langley Prairie (now Langley City) in 1947 to continue expanding his production capabilities and to expand his market. With Jacob making the product and Nettie, his wife, helping and doing the books, business continued on with their two sons Mike and Sam helping out after school and on the weekends.<br />
The plant in Langley, currently the site of the companies head office and a distribution yard for local customers, was expanded four times over the next ten years.<br />
<br />
The untimely death of Mike in 2003 due to complications while being treated for lung cancer slowed the building process but in 2006 the highly productive and efficient &lsquo;Superplant&rsquo; was commissioned.<br />
<br />
The strength of The Langley Concrete Group lies in it&rsquo;s employees. We currently employ 95 people at the Chilliwack plant and another 25 in Victoria at Lombard Precast. The company closed the Abbotsford and Langley production facilities but retained a distribution yard in Langley on the site of the Logan Ave. plant.<br />
<br />
Current management has a philosophy of increasing market share by reducing costs and increasing production capabilities while investing in new forms and equipment to expand product capabilities. Investments made to protect position in the market, stream line production, and further product lines match a desire to be the most efficient concrete products manufacturer in B.C. and the Pacific Northwest.<br />
<br />
Through the cooperation of our employees and the constant reinvestment of the shareholders the company is continuing to grow and progress with a culture of safety, enabling of employees and responding to the direct needs of customers.<br />

One said the company shut its doors and dismissed the roughly 35-40 employees remaining at its Mississauga, Ontario and Lafayette, Colo. operations.<br />
<br />
According to one source, employees were given no notice of the impending closure. They were told only that they were now without jobs and given orders to remove their personal belongings and turn in keys and company-issued credit cards.<br />
<br />
Another source reported that the order to discontinue operations had come from Sumavision, Larcan&rsquo;s majority owner based in China. LARCAN began a partnership with Beijing&rsquo;s Sumavision Technologies Co., Ltd. in 2009, with that company acquiring a controlling interest in LARCAN in late 2013.<br />
<br />
Multiple LARCAN executives did not respond to queries about the shutdown, which one source said came after orders for transmitters &ldquo;dried up.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
LARCAN had a long-established global reputation in the field of both solid-state and vacuum television transmitters in all power ranges. The company also manufactured FM broadcast transmitters and translators, as well as mobile DTV products. LARCAN has also provided of a range of engineering services in connection with transmitter installations.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
LARCAN was formally established in 1981 when employees of the Canadian General Electric and the LeBlanc and Royale organization purchased CGE&rsquo;s broadcast operation. The name LARCAN is an acronym for LeBlanc And Royal CANada. Until recently, LARCAN has been Canada&rsquo;s only manufacturer of both radio and television transmitters.

We invite you to browse around our site and get a good look at our products and services.<br />
<br />
To provide maximum natural lighting, a skylight is the answer. Unlike conventional wall windows, skylights are never totally in the shade. The amount of daylight reaching the interior of a structure through a skylight is up to 5 times greater than the amount of light from a wall window of equal size. Skylights also provide a more even distribution of natural light.<br />
<br />
Studies have shown that natural light is crucial to our well being and healthier for our eyes than artificial light. Artificial lighting is depressing and has an adverse effect on our minds and bodies.<br />
<br />
Skylights not only improve visual conditions in a building; they also create an atmosphere more stimulating to its occupants. In homes and buildings with skylights, plants grow abundantly no matter where they are placed within a room. Interior furnishings are seen in their true colors only under natural light. Not only are skylights an asset to any room because of the natural light they transmit, they also offer savings in electric power costs.<br />
<br />
In industrial and commercial buildings, skylights improve working conditions and offer unrestricted use of floor and wall space. The likelihood of vandalism and break-ins is reduced. Operable skylights provide ventilation and roof access. Skylights can be beneficial in building entrances, lobbies or foyers to spotlight pleasing features such as planters, fountains or works of art.<br />
<br />
The use of skylights is bringing about new design concepts in both residential and commercial construction. Skylights bring the outdoors indoors; yet with an abundance of light, are wonderfully private.<br />
<br />
Mac Skylights are available in a variety of sizes, shapes, styles and colors for individual or clustered installation on all types of buildings. Don\'t be deceived by imitations, insist on a Mac Skylight, the ultimate in design, variety and quality!</p>','company_name' => 'Mac Skylights ','company_email' => 'info@macskylights.com','address' => '5214, 93rd St NW','url' => 'www.macskylights.com  ','phone' => '(780) 435-3761','fax' => '(780) 435-1716','key_words' => '','logo' => '657.jpeg','video' => '','facebook' => NULL,'twitter' => NULL,'linked_in' => NULL,'youtube' => NULL,'google' => NULL,'image_1' => NULL,'image_2' => NULL,'image_3' => NULL,'image_4' => NULL),

Since 1974, our team has worked hard to earn an international reputation for beauty, craftsmanship and environmental responsibility.We at Madawaska Doors are committed to the environment. Wood is a renewable, reusable, recyclable and biodegradable. Non-wood products require far more energy to manufacture than wood.<br />
<br />
The supplies of ores and petroleum for the production of metal and plastic are finite and cause pollution of the air and water, contributing to global warming. One pound of wood grown in a vigorous younger forest removes 1.47 pounds of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and replaces it with 1.07 pounds of life-sustaining oxygen.<br />
<br />
Wood is also the best insulator of all structural building materials, with millions of tiny air cells trapped within its cellular structure providing a barrier against the heat and cold. An inch of wood is 15 times as efficient an insulator as concrete, 400 times as efficient as steel and 1770 times as efficient as aluminium. Homes built from wood require far less energy to heat and cool, thus conserving fossil fuels and coal.<br />
<br />
In a very real sense, wood products are the most environmentally responsible building material anyone could ever use. In addition, our manufacturing facility gathers all saw dust made from our equipment into a silo where a machine compresses the saw dust into firewood briquettes.

<br />
<br />
- Track shape and motion where cameras cannot see...<br />
- The snap of a neck during a car crash<br />
- The shape of a seat<br />
- A complex curve for a car body design<br />
- The motion of an athlete\'s knee<br />
- The sweeping moves of a dancer<br />
- Eddying currents of hot explosive gas<br />
- A crumpling door just before the airbag deploys<br />
- The position of a medical tool<br />
- The shape of a spine<br />
- Who needs these sensors?<br />
<br />
- Auto companies designing safer and more comfortable cars<br />
- Manufacturers improving efficiency of industrial processes<br />
- Manufacturers of simulation and training systems<br />
- Manufacturers of games and internet tools<br />
- Aerospace designers and maintenance workers<br />
- Remotely operated vehicle pilots<br />

- Rehabilitation clinics<br />
<br />
How do Measurand Sensors work?<br />
<br />
Cameras take in reflected light and form images. Measurand<br />
sensors mimic the complex curves of human or inanimate bodies,<br />
translating shape into electronic signals. Unlike cameras, they<br />
do this directly on the objects, requiring no extra space,<br />
focusing, or bright lights, and can move with the bodies,<br />
translating even the fastest moves into computer images or<br />
control signals. Measurand sensors do this with specially<br />
treated optical fibers used not to send telephone and television<br />
signals, but to sense curvature (bend and twist).</p>','company_name' => 'Measurand Inc.','company_email' => 'support@measurand.com','address' => '2111 Hanwell Rd','url' => 'www.measurand.com','phone' => '(506) 462-9119','fax' => '506) 462-9095','key_words' => '','logo' => '670.jpeg','video' => '','facebook' => NULL,'twitter' => NULL,'linked_in' => NULL,'youtube' => NULL,'google' => NULL,'image_1' => NULL,'image_2' => NULL,'image_3' => NULL,'image_4' => NULL),

Why buy you over the competition? And don&rsquo;t worry; if you don&rsquo;t have all the answers we can help there too.<br />

<br />
Quite simply, we at Misfit Studios are, and shall always be, gamers first and foremost, and that fact shall be the driving force behind everything we do.<br />
<br />
We publish a wide range of role-playing game products for a variety of game systems, often under license. Misfit Studios is also currently working on developing its first in-house set of rules, PD46FX, and a set of rules for dynamic miniature gaming.<br />
<br />
We are constantly in need of playtesters &mdash; even if it&rsquo;s just to proof read and double check game stats. If there is a product line you are interested in helping out with, email us with the subject line &ldquo;Playtesting&rdquo; and let us know why you think you&rsquo;d be a good fit and with which product lines you want to help.<br />
<br />
And when we say we want you to &ldquo;playtest&rdquo; for Misfit Studios Role Playing Games, we don&rsquo;t necessarily mean you have to put everything through its paces in an actual game. Usually, it is good enough to have a look at something, proof it, consider how it would operate in a game, and give feedback. Most playtesting is actually about assessing and evaluating new content.<br />
<br />
So, if you think you know the rules well enough for any of the role-playing game systems we are currently producing for, email us and sign up for some playtesting!<br />
<br />
The Misfit Studios Role Playing Games old message boards continued to break and find new problems arising with each required security update. The latest was the final straw that broke the software&rsquo;s back, rendering BBcode unusable. Considering this was the second iteration of the board we hosted on our own site that broke down during regular updating being glitchy, Misfit Studios has decided to move the message boards off-site.<br />
<br />
For quite some time, most customer and fan interactions have been via our blog and other social media outlets, so the relevancy of the message boards have long since been downgraded anyway. Still, they remain handy for product announcements and running playtests, so we have created a new board off-site, where we won&rsquo;t have to worry about upgrades and the like. The new message boards may be found here. So far, there&rsquo;s little there (beyond the playtesting materials a typical visitor can&rsquo;t see), but this will change over time.</p>','company_name' => 'Misfit Studios','company_email' => 'admin@misfit-studios.com','address' => '41 Trinnell Blvd','url' => 'www.misfit-studios.com','phone' => '(416) 857-2433','fax' => '','key_words' => '','logo' => '','video' => '','facebook' => NULL,'twitter' => NULL,'linked_in' => NULL,'youtube' => NULL,'google' => NULL,'image_1' => NULL,'image_2' => NULL,'image_3' => NULL,'image_4' => NULL),

MMG\'s beginnings goes back over 70 years as several different operating companies. The Neosid family of companies began manufacturing magnetic materials in the United Kingdom in 1936. They expanded their operations into Toronto, Canada in 1952 and Lilyfield, Australia in 1956. The Port Chester, New York Krystinel Corporation founded in 1954 was acquired by the UK based Magnetic Materials Group (MMG) in 1989. In 1990, the Group also acquired the magnetic interests of Salford Electrical Instruments (SEI). In 1974, the Chennai based EID Parry India Limited, a subsidiary of the Murugappa Group, with the assistance Siemens, began the operation of a soft ferrite plant in Chennai, India. This facility was later acquired by the TT Group in 1997. The UK based TT Group, now known as TT electronics, acquired MMG in 1992.<br />
<br />
In 2010 MMG was acquired from TT Electronics. MMG Canada Ltd continues to be commited to it\'s global markets and customers and will continue it\'s supply focus into leading manufacturers in the automotive.&nbsp; telecommunications, computing and industrial electronics markets.<br />

They service independent retail lumber dealers throughout all of Canada, and are beginning their transition into the U.S. market. NFP owns a distribution facility, strategically located in Orillia, ON. With a location just north of Toronto, and just south of the Muskoka region, it gives them a great central location to service Ontario and Quebec markets. NFP also facilitates warehouse space in Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, and now New Jersey, to have product able to service nearby markets.</p>

<div>Over the last decade, National Forest Products has grown and expanded its business. With the development of the Pinnacle programs, and the opening of two other divisions, NFP has begun to separate itself from the competition.

In 2011, NFP began a manufacturing division that handles Western Red Cedar Specialties &amp; Exports.

It offers high resistance to the passage of heat energy - it is a very effective insulator. It is also economical, offering high R-value per dollar.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Expanded foams (EPS) are commonly known as bead boards. The raw material is a small bead. These are heated with steam and the softened plastic expands as the pentane gas trapped in the plastic beads expands. These pre-expanding beads are then cured during an aging process. The cured beads are than introduced to a mold where further contact with steam softens and expands the beads to fill the mold cavity and fuse the beads tightly together. The molded foam can be in large rectangular blocks that are further processed by cutting with hot wires into standard sized sheets or custom cut billets. This is known as block molding. The basic EPS blocks are cut and shaped to produce a variety of Truefoam sheet, board and panel products including Truewall, Truefit, Foundation Plus/Sheathing, Insulwall, and others.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">For certain Truefoam products, such as Reward Wall ICFs and Styropack shipping containers, the polystyrene is shape moulded during final expansion.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">EPS is structurally rigid and stable, yet very light. It is very easy to cut and shape using the simplest of tools. It produces no irritating fibres or annoying dust. EPS products make the job quicker for both contractors and do-it-yourselfers.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">EPS insulation doesn\'t change or deteriorate over time. EPS sheets and panels cannot sag or bunch. EPS insulation is unaffected by freeze-thaw cycles, and cannot rot or mould. EPS insulation\'s R-value is permanent.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">EPS insulation is very resistant to the passage of water, yet it &quot;breathes.&quot; Vapour passes through. This avoids condensation buildup within walls, a serious problem which can arise with other insulation systems. And because of the rigid closed-cell structure of EPS, there is no possibility of the kind of air movement inside the wall which can lead to heat loss in loose or blanket materials.<o:p></o:p></p>','company_name' => 'Newfoundland Styro Inc.','company_email' => 'info@nfstyro.com','address' => '12 Dominic St.Industrial Pk.','url' => 'www.nfstyro.com ','phone' => '(709) 258-5890','fax' => '(709) 258-6015','key_words' => '','logo' => '742.jpeg','video' => '','facebook' => NULL,'twitter' => NULL,'linked_in' => NULL,'youtube' => NULL,'google' => NULL,'image_1' => NULL,'image_2' => NULL,'image_3' => NULL,'image_4' => NULL),

This niche was born in 1997 out of a growing demand from surgeons who wanted to be able to treat children as distinct individuals with their own complexities and needs, and not as small adults. The first two pediatric products that initiated this trend towards maintaining the normal growth of the child while correcting the deformity consisted on a non-fusion spinal device for the correction of idiopathic scoliosis and a telescopic rod for correcting bone deformities in OI (known today as the Fassier-Duval telescopic IM system).</p>

<div>Pioneer Log Furniture is a family owned and operated business and has been building handcrafted log furniture for nearly a quarter of a century. Starting about 1980 we began in our basement building for neighbors and friends, and today have over 5000 square feet of shop area and ship around the world to the USA, Germany and Japan.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Our family consist of myself, Daniel, my wife Della and our five children, Johanna, Deborah, Rebekah, Amos and Andrew. They are all a big help: peeling logs, sanding, drilling, packaging, answering phones, doing shows and a 1,000 other things. It is nice to be able to work together (and somethimes scrap) as a family and be able to instill in them the values, traditions and principles that will make them a valuable asset to their generation. We believe in putting God first in all things and in having the principles of honesty and integrity being reflected in our life whether it is at home, in our work or at play.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Our master craftsmen include Jonathan who can design and build anything. Harry and Danny both born in South America brought many skills with them when they joined the team at Pioneer Log Furniture. Lester is our experienced cabinet and case goods professional with over 25 years in the industry.

They called it &ldquo;growth partnering&rdquo;, and it meant that Q&rsquo;Max intended to work as a partner, focused on helping customers&rsquo; achieve success in their projects at lowest total cost.

<div>The approach has been successful. Today, Q&rsquo;Max employs almost 1,400 people within 9 countries, each country represents a fully equipped and self-sufficient independent business unit.

<div>Quality Hardwoods Ltd is a wholesale Hardwood Lumber business located on a twenty &ndash; acre site in Powassan, Ontario. This prime location is situated on Highway 11, just three hours north of Toronto and a short drive to North Bay, Ontario. It has quick and easy access to ports, railheads and sawmills via highway 400/11N. The business was established in 1981 by Paul Brooks, the Company\'s President. His vision, hard work, honesty and determination have been the basis for the continued growth and success of the Company. In recognization for his accomplishments, Paul was awarded the Northern Region Leadership Award of merit for excellence in Export Development for 2001 and was also awarded Entrepreneur of the Year in 2002. We purchase green lumber from many sawmills throughout Quebec and Northern and Southern Ontario. The lumber is dried in one of our 10 Nardi Dry Kilns and stored in steel warehouses which are insulated, heated and climate controlled year-round. The kilns have a drying capacity of 450,000 board feet and the kiln-dried lumber is never exposed to the elements. A Newman double planer and automated grading line have been incorporated into one of the warehouses and these value added additions contribute to the overall quality of our product. The planer is designed to handle both short and long stock, and the grading line can do 22 different sorts for color, length and grade. Constant expansions and upgrades assist the company in making customer satisfaction a priority. Primary species include Red Oak, Ash Cherry, Aspen, Basswood, Yellow and White Birch and Hard and Soft Maple. Over 90% of what we have in stock is 1 &amp; better grade.

<div>Sager was established in 1983 by Santo Fata Sr. as a packager of vegetable oil products primarily for grocery chains and foodservice distributors. In the early 1980s, Canadian grocery chains began introducing private label products in their own stores to compete with the established national brands. Sager was among the first suppliers to this market segment which has and continues to grow at a strong rate. Many of our client relationships date back many years and we are very proud to have the privilege of serving Canada\'s leading grocery chains.</div>

<div>In addition to our private label business, Sager packs a number of products under national brands. These co-packing clients represent an important part of both our retail and foodservice businesses. In addition, since its inception, Sager has also developed its own brands including La Perla, Cantalia and Regina. La Perla, Cantalia and Regina products can be found throughout Canada. Recently, Sager has broadened its product offering to include organic oils and a wide assortment of sauces.</div>

Due to the rapid growth of health and fitness, accidents relating to sports also sharply increased. After this research Seven Star Sports commenced R&amp;D to develop a new line of safety helmets for the cycling and inline skating industry. Early 1994 seen the design and completion of 4 helmet lines that had been developed. All the regulatory approvals CSA, ANSI and ASTM have been received and commercial production commenced February 1995. The company was now a 100% dedicated to manufacturing &amp; distribution of helmets. Subsequently other lines were added such as sports gloves, protective wear, ball items (soccer balls, basketballs, footballs) and skateboards. Seven Star Sports started its helmet production in Burlington, Ontario and moved to Hamilton, Ontario in early 1998. Our headquarters are in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Every year tens of thousands of boats are stolen, with very few ever recovered. Boats are stolen from almost everywhere: from back yards, from front driveways, from marinas, from service yards, and even from motels on the way to or from vacation.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">However, theft of the boat itself is not the only risk. Increasingly thieves are targeting equipment and electronics on boats in marinas. Outboards and tenders are favourite targets as they are easily transported and even if secured with chains or locks, are rarely monitored by security systems or boat alarms.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Theft is not the only event that can cause the loss of a boat. Every year boats sink where they are moored in marinas. A failed through hull fitting can eventually overpower a bilge pump or cause the bilge pump to drain the battery and sink the boat.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The solution is to use a security system for your boat that monitors not only entry points on the boat, but also important status points such as bilge water level, battery voltage and even temperature. A boat alarm is not enough. A two-way remote monitoring system will keep you informed<o:p></o:p></p>

With the release of the A&amp;L Medical System in 1985, A&amp;L started directing its product line toward the medical market in Ontario, more specifically to medical offices and clinics. A&amp;L has worked closely with the Ontario Medical Association, medical laboratories and the Ontario Ministry of Health to ensure that its software applications align well to the specific needs of its clients. A&amp;L\'s president, Alex Yuan was granted the 1995 Entrepreneur Of The Year award from the Town of Richmond Hill, Ontario. In 1998 he also recieved the Entrepreneur Of The Year award from the Association of Chinese Canadian Entrepreneurs and the Outstanding Business Achievment Award from the Ontario Chamber of Commerce. In 1992, A&amp;L took over Medics, a competitor, helping to expand its presence throughout Ontario, and also leading to the development of a joint marketing venture with the University of Toronto the following year. This resulted in A&amp;L donating 33% of its software revenue to the University of Toronto and the Chinese Community Nursing Home for Greater Toronto.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">In 1994, A&amp;L released its document imaging program, A&amp;L Document Console, expanding its potential client base beyond the medical community (and beyond Ontario) to include a variety of business venues. This software product allows all documents, whether they be text, photographs, charts, etc., to be stored and indexed on computer databases for immediate access. This can allow a business to run a virtually paperless office and to electronically route all documents anywhere in the world. In 1995, A&amp;L launched a joint venture with another Ontario company, HTN Incorporated, in order to develop and market the Healthcare Electronic Resources On-Line (HERO*) network for Ontario physicians. It provided the Ontario healthcare industry with its first comprehensive transactional network. A&amp;L HERO*, a Windows based application, provides electronic OHIP billing, scheduling and e-mail in addition to the capability for laboratory requisitions and prescription transmission in association with those laboratories and pharmacies who will eventually subscribe to the network. A&amp;L now has a 30% share of HTN Incorporated, and continues to develop and market the HERO* network through its Client Service Centers and business partners across Ontario. (\'HERO*\' is a registered trademark of HTN Incorporated.) In 1997, A&amp;L expanded into the United States by opening its first Dealership for A&amp;L Document Console in Fallbrook, California.

Steel is one of the most versatile and enduring materials in existence. Wroughtiron originally meant working iron and alloys into useful works. This was done by hand and required skill and imagination. Today wrought iron means a whole lot more; more materials to work with like aluminum and copper as examples; better tools (like CNC) and equipment, but one thing has remained and that is the ingenious craftsman and artist who brings basic metal shapes into wonderful craftsmenship construction that are strong, long lived while adding beauty and value.

The dream that inspired the vision began with Barry Marsden, Cascade\'s founder who got his pilot\'s license at 17 and thus began a life-long relationship with machines that fly. Marsden\'s love of flying led him to co-found Conair Group, a specialty aviation services firm, in 1969.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Conair\'s initial focus was aerial forest fire control. The experience acquired in developing specialty aviation products and operating and maintaining a fleet of 90 aircraft gave Conair the expertise required to offer third-party maintenance and modifications. That expertise inspired a more expansive vision. By 1993, Marsden, forward thinking about aviation - envisioned a new enterprise dedicated to providing third-party maintenance. That vision became a reality when Conair moved into a new, state-of-the-art, 230,000-square-foot facility in December 2000. In spring 2001, the third-party maintenance division became a separate company with a new name: Cascade Aerospace.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The passion and foresight that the founders brought to Cascade attracted other skilled and dedicated people to the company.

CAST\'s clients are armed with the tools and confidence to perform to the highest standards. CAST\'s 1988 launch marked the creation and delivery of a specialized training program for municipal fire fighters whose area of responsibility included airports. CAST reshaped conventional wisdom by originating a revolutionary program designed to meet this crucial safety need, not only more economically, but also more efficiently, by employing existing municipal structural fire fighting personnel, equipment, expertise and experience. CAST its growth through developing, auditing and reviewing emergency and security plans for airlines, airports, corporations, and governments across Canada and worldwide. All plans, exercises and audits have been tailored to meet the unique requirements of individual clients.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">When the U.S. government introduced legislation which required all airlines to submit plans under the Aviation Disaster Family Assistance Act (1996) and the Foreign Air Carrier Family Support Act (1997), CAST developed comprehensive plans to align its client airlines with their obligations to keep pace with evolving American regulations.&nbsp; And CAST pioneered the concept of gathering under one umbrella the expanding array of services that airlines and other organizations are increasingly expected to marshal, while preparing for or responding to incidents. In accordance with heightening expectations of both regulators and the public, CAST fashioned unprecedented response programs designed to harness and coordinate all aspects of crisis response plans and procedures.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">It was during this development phase that CAST, together with Rural/Metro Corporation of Arizona, founded the Emergency Measures Inquiry Center (EMIC) in Scottsdale which led to the partnership\'s development of the world\'s first major transportation emergency operation to combine under one contract the three definitive components of complete emergency response: preparedness, response, and long-term repatriation and disposition of personal effects. This original EMIC prototype became the acknowledged standard for other large-scale, worldwide systems, which were to follow (In 2000, Rural/Metro acquired full ownership of EMIC while CAST intensified its focus on further development of innovative safety and security capabilities.).<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">CAST answered the call from Bombardier Aerospace to provide project safety management for the mammoth 2002 World Youth Day and 2003 SAR&rsquo;s benefit concert events held at the company\'s Downsview airfield in Toronto. These were 2 of the largest events of their kind in the world with the World Youth Day hosting almost a million participants from around the globe. It was CAST\'s responsibility to guide and coordinate such diverse tasks as keeping the work of on-site construction crews in accordance with Canada\'s Civil Aviation Regulations, red-flagging potential safety and logistical hot spots during the event, and ensuring that post-event cleanup and repairs returned the airfield promptly and safely to its normal functions.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Most recently CAST has pioneered the development of a practical approach to aviation Safety Management Systems. Based on extensive hands-on experience in a variety of safety critical environments&nbsp; including developing SMS philosophies, policies, procedures and practices for international airlines and other complex organizations,&nbsp; CAST&rsquo;s approach to SMS is providing clients with a simple, efficient and cost effective means of managing&nbsp; today&rsquo;s evolving safety and emergency management environment.<o:p></o:p></p>','company_name' => 'CAST Safety Systems','company_email' => 'castsafety@gmail.com','address' => '362 Moffatt St','url' => 'www.castsafety.com/ ','phone' => '(613) 219-5129','fax' => '(613) 257-8395','key_words' => '','logo' => '1130.jpeg','video' => '','facebook' => NULL,'twitter' => NULL,'linked_in' => NULL,'youtube' => NULL,'google' => NULL,'image_1' => NULL,'image_2' => NULL,'image_3' => NULL,'image_4' => NULL),

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Rose Valade is the owner and designer of CatnRose Jewelry. Her passion for jewellery was rivalled only by her desire to redesign the pieces that she had purchased during her time traveling and living throughout Europe and the Orient. When people started noticing her redesigned pieces the idea of starting her own line of jewellery began to form.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Rose originally looked at working with vintage stones, redesigning them into original modern pieces. A trip to the Orient in February of 2003 soon changed Rose&rsquo;s mind. For many year&rsquo;s she had been fascinated and mesmerized by the natural visual experience of visiting the Orient. Her home, filled with treasures from her travels, along with her trip to Hong Kong soon convinced Rose that combining her two loves of jewellery and beautiful gemstones was the key to developing CatnRose Jewelry.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Inspiration has never been a problem for Rose. She spends hours everyday testing and playing with combinations of gemstones evaluating them for brilliance, size, patterns and colour.

In late 1999 DI Homepages Ltd. became known as INGEN Web Design and in May of 2000 we signed up our first client Prall Trucking Ltd. We developed a website that satisfied his needs and they were pleased with our work. Still needing a bigger foothold, in December 2000, with the help of a great aunt, the name of DNI Web Design came to light when she gave the CEO a sweater with a logo on it (as she worked at an advertising company), and the name and logo stuck. In 2004, the trademark of DNI Web Design took on the 3D look it has today.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">In the fall of 2001, we got one of the biggest clients we currently have, the Tri-Town Thunder from Carrot River. Still in school Dawson was approached by team executive (who happened to be his english teacher and his principle at the time) to create a website for the team. This project lead to two later clients, the North Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League (2002) and the Big River Timberkings (2005).<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">In February of 2004, Dawson meet Jay Semko of the Northern Pikes at the Artful Dodger, where he went to see them play. Being a devoted fan who created a website about the Northern Pikes this help us get Jay Semko to allow us to help maintain his site, with a possible re-design of the site in the future. In April 2004 we got one of our largest clients to date, the Nipawin/Diamond North Credit Union. We sent in a proposal when we learned the current staff and executive were unpleased with their current web site and designer. We then meet with some of the personnel in charge of the website and it\'s content and created a design to meet their needs. We used the colours they wanted and did exactly what they want and so they were very pleased with our work.<o:p></o:p></p>','company_name' => 'DNI Web Design','company_email' => 'dniwebdesign@sasktel.net','address' => 'P.O.

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Dynamic Air Cleaners utilize active&ndash;field, non-ionizing polarized-media technology. &nbsp;While Dynamic has pioneered and perfected its application to air cleaning in general HVAC applications, the basic principals have been around for a long time. In fact, the word &ldquo;electricity&rdquo; comes from the Greek word for amber, elekton. &nbsp;It was observed that dust particles would hop onto amber after it had been rubbed. &nbsp;That magical force was called electricity. &nbsp;The first electrically-enhanced air filters date back to 1930 and combine elements of both passive and electrostatic filtration. As with most high-efficiency filtration products, polarized media had its roots in industrial applications. Although there have been a number of different configurations since then, all are based on charging, or polarizing, fibers in a media and particles in the air in order to generate an electric force between the fibers and particles. While the principle has been around for many decades, it has only been in recent years that the technology has been fully understood to maximize effectiveness and to provide consistent, reliable performance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In 1982, two university professors from Carleton University in Ontario, Canada developed a polarized media design for a residential application that provided a simple means of replacing dirty media. They started Engineering Dynamics, Ltd. (EDL) and began manufacturing 1&rdquo; and 2&rdquo; polarized-media air cleaners, room console units and overhead ceiling-mount units, all under the Dynamic brand. All of the polarized-media air cleaners on the market today can be traced back to beginnings at EDL, although subsequent patents and refinements have created discernable differences in the product designs and features.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In 1993, EDL was acquired by Environmental Dynamics Group, one of EDL&rsquo;s largest distributors. &nbsp;The companies are now known as Dynamic Air Quality Solutions. &nbsp;The primary manufacturing remains in Carleton Place, Ontario, while sales and engineering are based in the Princeton, New Jersey headquarters. &nbsp; While EDL&rsquo;s initial focus was primarily residential, Dynamic has also worked to address the clear need for improved air quality and energy savings in commercial and industrial applications. This has resulted in a focus on technology enhancements, new configurations, and a complete line of commercial products that now dominate in some categories, with healthcare and energy retrofits being the two largest business segments.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Dynamic has doubled sales every few years, invests heavily in research and product development and has a variety of patents in the field.</div>','company_name' => 'Engineering Dynamics Limited','company_email' => 'robin@dynamicaqs.com','address' => '137 Pick Rd','url' => 'www.dynamicaqs.com ','phone' => '(613) 257-5450','fax' => '(613) 257-7397','key_words' => '','logo' => '1260.jpeg','video' => '','facebook' => NULL,'twitter' => NULL,'linked_in' => NULL,'youtube' => NULL,'google' => NULL,'image_1' => NULL,'image_2' => NULL,'image_3' => NULL,'image_4' => NULL),

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Incorporated in British Columbia, Canada since 1980, Originally known as Excel Medical Systems, FMS X-RAY (a division of Excel Professional Services, EPS) and its founder Fred J.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">FMS X-Ray has built a reputation for reliability and excellence in this complex and exacting field. From the onset, Mr. Fischer pioneered the concept of a highly focused, micro-corporation offering to the medical profession viable alternatives to the high cost of equipment purchases and service contracts in the specialized fields of medical diagnostic imaging equipment. At that time, virtually all contracts were handled by large firms such as Siemens, General Electric, Philips, and Picker. Such corporations, with their large infrastructures and overhead, had a significant negative impact on the scant financial resources available for the propagation of quality medical and diagnostic products and services. FMS X-Ray&rsquo;s vision was to provide cost-effective alternative solutions.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Mr. Fischer broke this de facto monopoly by challenging the parts supply policies of the larger manufacturing firms, and by painstakingly establishing himself and his organization as a technically and operationally competent service organization.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">In addition to challenging the status quo in the industry, FMS X-Ray has diversified its client base among hospitals, doctors, veterinarians, dentists, physiotherapists and chiropractors, and has established a well deserved high reputation in both service and sales.

While GBS initially operated solely in the Province of Ontario the company now operates from Dartmouth to Victoria and as far north as the Arctic Circle. Our clients range from several of the largest most recognizable names in the grocery and foodservice segments right thru to those beautifully unique individual owner/operator restaurants in your neighbourhood.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>GBS was initially a manufacturer of rotisserie equipment supplying large and small grocers in the Ontario market. In the spring of 2001 the company was purchased by the Douglas Group of Companies and Mr. Paul Douglas, the primary shareholder of the Douglas Group. Mr. Douglas immediately set on the task of improving all aspects of sales, service and support by expanding the GBS product lines and re-investing in staff and support technology. This re-investment took the GBS product line from four items to the current 200+, and it allowed the company to offer more products and services to an ever growing list of customers. GBS has built a solid group of highly trained service technicians to support their growth, so a customer making a purchase in Toronto, St. Johns, or Vancouver knows they will receive the same great service right across the country.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In 2003 GBS made its first substantial sales foray into Quebec, moving into the Maritime provinces in &rsquo;05 and into western Canada in 06. Mr. Douglas and his team of professionals now support hundreds and hundreds of customers across Canada, ranging from some of the largest multi unit operators in the country right down to the small single unit restaurant on your local corner. What has allowed GBS to grow over the past several years is their published motto/mission statement &ldquo;the Foodservice Company with the emphasis on SERVICE&rdquo;! &nbsp;GBS treats each and every client the way they expect, their business is the MOST important. This is only been achievable due to the commitment and experience of the entire GBS team.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In addition to a backbone of traditional type equipment, rotisseries or fryers for example, GBS offers a wide range of unique, energy or labour saving equipment. In the current line-up GBS boasts five &ldquo;KI Award&rdquo; (Kitchen Innovations) winning products &ndash; truly offering existing or future clients some of the most innovate equipment opportunities in the marketplace. The GBS team, and Paul Douglas in particular, search the world looking for solutions to common commercial cooking issues thus ensuring that if it&rsquo;s new, if it&rsquo;s unique and if it&rsquo;s going to solve an issue GBS is likely the place to look.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>As we move into 2014 the focus of everyone at GBS continues to be customer service and satisfaction. By continuing to focus on the fundamentals of good service our customers past, present and future can rest assured that what they purchase will be quality, will be fairly priced and will be fully supported.</div>','company_name' => 'GBS Food Service Equipment Inc.','company_email' => 'sjaffer@gbscooks.com','address' => '951 Matheson Blvd E','url' => 'www.gbscooks.com ','phone' => '(905) 897-2333','fax' => '(905) 897-2334','key_words' => '','logo' => '1335.jpeg','video' => '','facebook' => NULL,'twitter' => NULL,'linked_in' => NULL,'youtube' => NULL,'google' => NULL,'image_1' => NULL,'image_2' => NULL,'image_3' => NULL,'image_4' => NULL),

They discovered pellet furnaces and boilers and were attracted to their low cost heating fuel and environmentally responsible reputation. At the time there were no locally produced pellets available, only imports from Quebec or British Columbia. Through research it became apparent that wood pellets had many benefits as a heating fuel for rural Ontario, and that there would be a growing demand for this economical fuel source.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Using the equipment and experience from a separate business, Jim and Scott were able to launch themselves into the world of pellet production. In the winter of 2006/2007, Gildale Farms began selling fuel pellets and started to establish a loyal customer base built on great service and quality pellets.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The name Gildale originates from the area of Scott\'s grandparent\'s farm, near Mount Forest.

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>HCI was founded in 1986. In 1993, we opened our own separate casting plant which has greatly added to our product selection and custom manufacturing capabilities. In 1995, the assembly plant and head of&#61441;ce was moved into much larger facilities where we are presently located. In 1996, the product line was split into two separate product lines &mdash; Lighting and Site Furniture. In 1997, both product lines were expanded to include many unique and popular designs. In 1998 the company name was changed from Heritage Casting &amp; Ironworks into HCI for easier brand name recognition.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Over the years the company has evolved to a point where it &#61441;nds itself in a unique position. We provide a very wide range of popular lighting and site improvement products used by municipalites and developers: &#61441;xtures, poles, arms, bollards, street signs, benches, litter containers, recycling containers, planters, bike racks, tree guards and tree grates. We are also very skilled at developing new custom designs or matching existing product.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>With all this experience and capabilities we are in position to be your manufacturer of choice for lighting and site improvement products. All from one manufacturer, all the same color, high quality, all delivered at the same time, on time and done right the &#61441;rst time! Here are some additional reasons why we feel you should select HCI as your favorite manufacturer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In today&rsquo;s hectic world, reliable, on-time delivery is more important than ever before. We understand and appreciate how critical project deadlines are and that many times these change. To the degree possible, we aim to accommodate various customer requirements, including rush deliveries, while keeping the integrity of our production schedule.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We offer customized products! &nbsp;All of our standard products could be modi&#61441;ed or a custom designed from scratch - quickly and competively, we can bring your concepts into reality. What is more, with 3D parametric design software we can render realistic images of new or existing designs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Our professional approach to business has resulted in literally thousands of installations in some of the most prestigious addresses in North America.

When Henry died in 1926 his son Lorne took over the business. Lorne retired in 1945, selling the mill to his nephews/employees Carl and Otto Stoskopf. In 1974 Carl and Otto sold the business to John and Sharon Ogilvie effectively making them the second family to run the business. Otto and longtime employee Stan Schellenberger continued to work with John since he only had business sense and knew little about carpentry and lumber. Carl and son Steve Strasser also came onboard during the 70\'s. John and Sharon\'s son Reg began working in the mill fulltime in 1987.Then 10 years later, Reg made the next major step in placing the Mill online in June of 1997 with steady growth ever since. January 2005 son Reg and wife Ruth Ann purchased the mill from John and Sharon after they achieved more than 30 years of operation of this business.

<div>Dangerous/unpleasant/fatiguing operations.</div>
<div>Two to three shift working. It is easier to justify the cost of investment over multiple shifts.</div>
<div>Critical handling. A part may be easily damaged or contaminated. Automation can be cleaner and more consistent.</div>
<div>Labour-Intensive Operations</div>
<div>Skills difficult to retain. Automated machinery can be programmed to supplement these skills.</div>
<div>Operations with high labour turnover. The use of automation will avoid costs of recruitment and training.</div>
<div>Process bottleneck operations.</div>
<div>Poor uptime of sensitive machines, due to inconsistent loading by operators.</div>
<div>Expensive floor space. An automated system might require less space.</div>
<div>Products specifically designed with automation in mind - for example assembly operations.</div>
<div>Gauging and testing operations. Automation will reduce operator inconsistency and time consuming setups. Results can automatically be fed in to an SPC system for statistical tracking.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Operations to Avoid Automation Exhibit the Following Characteristics</div>
<div>Out of control processes. Automation will fail in an unstructured, poorly controlled environment; it cannot adapt to change like people can.</div>
<div>Poor parts consistency. People are usually fairly successful at checking parts before assembling/processing them and &quot;making them fit&quot; if possible. To error proof the process you must be prepared to use a high number of sensors, or use a vision system, for parts checking (and create a very complex machine in the process). It is better to put the effort into finding and fixing the problem at the source and then consider the automation.</div>
<div>Complex manipulative operations. Nothing yet competes with human manipulation and hand-eye co-ordination skills. Unless the operation can be broken down into a series of elementary stages, do not bother. Just admire the skill of a good worker.</div>

URS was established in 1951, and incorporated in 1957 as Broadview Research&mdash;a research group active in the area of physical and engineering sciences. In 1967, management developed a growth strategy focused on building a multidisciplinary professional services firm. In 1968, Broadview Research acquired United Research Incorporated of Cambridge, Massachusetts. During this period, the name Broadview Research was changed to United Research Services and later shortened to URS.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, URS continued to expand through internal growth and strategic acquisitions that enhanced our engineering, architectural and environmental practices. These acquisitions included Madigan-Praeger; Coverdale and Colpitts; John A. Blume and Associates; Hill Dreman Chase; and Dalton, Dalton and Newport.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">In 1996, URS further expanded with the acquisition of Greiner Engineering, which broadened our presence in the transportation market. The Woodward-Clyde Group joined URS in 1997, bringing additional environmental capabilities and a broader international presence to the organization. When Dames &amp; Moore Group joined the Company in 1999, it further widened our geographic base, strengthened our program and construction management expertise, added to our FORTUNE 500 client base and expanded our presence in the mass transit market.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">In 2002, the acquisition of EG&amp;G Technical Services, a provider of management and technical support services to U.S. government agencies&mdash;the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security in particular&mdash;positioned URS among the ranks of the leading U.S. federal services contractors.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The 2007 acquisition of Washington Group International enhanced URS&rsquo; ability to provide integrated engineering and construction services throughout the project life cycle&mdash;from planning, design and engineering through construction to operations and maintenance, and decommissioning and closure. The acquisition also expanded our capabilities in the power and nuclear management markets, as well as in transportation, mining, defense, and industrial infrastructure and process.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">In 2010, URS acquired the Scott Wilson Group&mdash;a global integrated design and engineering consultancy based in the United Kingdom. The addition of Scott Wilson allowed us to significantly enhance our resources and capabilities in key United Kingdom and Ireland infrastructure markets. We also expanded our presence in Continental Europe, the Middle East, China and India.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">In May 2012, URS acquired Flint Energy Services&mdash;one of North America&rsquo;s leading providers of production, construction and maintenance services to the oil and gas industry. The acquisition enabled URS to provide life-cycle services for the full range of upstream, midstream and downstream projects in both the conventional and unconventional oil and gas markets, including the development and production of oil shales, tight oil, and oil sands.<o:p></o:p></p>

<div>VMAC, a Division of Mangonel Investments Corporation, is situated on almost 8 acres of land, in the middle of a lush Cedar tree forest approximately 8 kilometers (5 miles) south of Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada.</div>

<div>Our Team</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The VMAC team is lead by President, Jim Hogan and consists of an international Dealer Network and sales force, innovative engineering and design crew, manufacturing and service specialists, plus high caliber administration and management professionals. The rapid growth of VMAC has caused a workforce expansion to approximately 100 full and part-time employees, all highly trained in their important roles at VMAC.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Company History</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The company was founded in Kitchener, Ontario, when two school friends, Tony Menard and Jim Hogan, decided that their entrepreneurial ideas required additional working capital. So, they decided to open their own machine shop. On August 8, 1986, VMAC (Vehicle Mounted Air Compressors) was incorporated under the name of Mangonel Corporation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>By 1988, VMAC had become specialized in the manufacture of UNDERHOOD mounting brackets for truck-mounted air compressors. In 1990, Tony moved the company to his native hometown, Nanaimo, British Columbia. Jim had decided to stay in Ontario instead of moving with Tony but four years later, he rejoined the business.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>By 1996, the company had designed and introduced an electronic throttle control to complement its product range. VMAC Throttle Commander products are currently used on most popular light-duty work trucks for the construction, tire service truck, utility, emergency equipment, mining, forestry, and agriculture industries.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Beginning in 1997, Tony realized that reciprocating compressors UNDERHOOD would not be viable in future aerodynamic truck designs. In September 1997, VMAC introduced a new mobile air solution that would revolutionize the industry &ndash; the UNDERHOOD VR7000 (a.k.a. VR70) rotary screw air compressor system.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>VMAC continued to expand its VR70 and Throttle Commander product base over the next few years. And in 2002, VMAC once again amazed the mobile compressed air industry by introducing the VR150, doubling the output of the VR70 while remaining UNDERHOOD. The power of this unit allowed VMAC to compete with tow-behind portable air compressors.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Several years ago Lincoln Electric, a leader in welding system manufacturing, approached VMAC to build a product that would compliment a welder application to meet the needs of its customers. After some initial evaluation, the Research and Design Department at VMAC took the project on and introduced a product that worked directly with the Lincoln system. The Air Vantage 500 combined the functions of a Welder, Generator and Air Compressor. This product design helped VMAC make advances in other product developments.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In 2004, VMAC set out on an aggressive customer-focused research campaign, to find its next great product line. Utilizing the knowledge gained from the research and experience gained from manufacturing UNDERHOOD Air Compressor systems for ten years, VMAC developed the world&rsquo;s lightest and smallest above deck hydraulic powered air compressor system. The powerful PREDATAIR60 Hydraulic Air Compressor System took VMAC from a niche supplier of UNDERHOOD Air Compressor Systems to a supplier in a mainstream market whereby many companies compete for market share. The launch in 2005 was one of the most exciting launches VMAC has ever seen.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In July 2010, VMAC was deeply saddened by the loss of president Tony Menard in an accident. Jim Hogan took over as president of the company, which rallied to carry on the founder&rsquo;s vision.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>VMAC continues to deliver application solutions to a broad spectrum of the market and is encouraged that other manufactures are following their lead in the area of UNDERHOOD technology.

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The People</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>All of the engineering and production employees at WAEC previously worked for CGE designing and building motor control centers. As such, no one in the electrical industry knows more about the CR7092C and CR2000 MCC&rsquo;s than the staff at WAEC.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The Products</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Simply put &ndash; Factory Original</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Since we purchased the complete motor control center business from CGE we are pleased to inform you that all products produced by WAEC are equivalent to factory original. There is no guess work involved. Each part conforms to original factory specifications and will install quickly and easily into the equipment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Replacement units &amp; parts for the CR7092C and CR2000 employ modern starters, disconnects, and breakers. Every MCC unit is custom-built to satisfy your specifications. Our MCC\'s are very cost effective and we provide quick service when you need to upgrade.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>WAEC also manufactures the CR9440 magnetector line of proximity switches. &nbsp;These magnetic switches are ideal for those locations either too harsh or dirty for normal sensors. &nbsp;The CR9440 sensor can sense distances of .5&quot; to 5&quot;. &nbsp;These sensors are CSA approved for Class 1 Groups C&amp;D and Class II Groups F&amp;G hazardous locations.</div>

The literature review of lifecycle assessment of wind, nuclear and natural gas generation claims that emissions from wind and nuclear are similar, with the exception of GHG emissions where wind produces &ldquo;distinctly less&rdquo; emissions than nuclear. The nuclear study claims that nuclear can be less GHG intensive than a scenario where wind and natural gas jointly generate power. The Canadian Wind Energy Association says wind can partner with hydroelectric, solar or energy storage and DSM technologies and, &ldquo;by choosing to focus on only one scenario, the study failed to consider a broad range of equally or more plausible scenarios for the future evolution of Canada\'s electricity grid.&rdquo; GHG emissions must be &ldquo;an increasingly important consideration in the selection of future sources&rdquo; of electricity, but CanWEA adds that the cost-competitiveness of new generation sources and their overall environmental performance and economic benefits are also important. Wind is cheaper than new nuclear reactors and is cost-competitive with new hydroelectric facilities, and is not subject to commodity and carbon price risks facing natural gas.</p>

<div>2014-10-21 (canadian association for renewable energies) The 140 MW solar PV facility in Kingston was one of the top asset finance transactions of the third quarter of this year, at $525 million, according the latest &lsquo;Global Trends in Clean Energy Investment&rsquo; produced by Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Total investment in Canada was $1.9 billion in Q3, up from $1.3 bn in Q2, and compares with $7.3 bn in the US, down from $10.7 bn in Q2 but up from $5.7 bn in Q3 of last year. Global investment in renewables totalled $175 bn in the first three quarters of 2014 &ldquo;as the sector shows signs of a worldwide recovery after a two-year slump,&rdquo; with most of the increase in China and Japan. Support fell to an eight-year low in Europe. &ldquo;There is no room for complacency because clean energy investment of between $200 bn and $300 bn a year is not large enough to herald the rapid transformation of the power system that experts say is required if the world is to see a peak in CO2 emissions around 2020,&rdquo; the report notes.</div>

The five hundred members of Wabigoon belong to the great Ojibway Nation of the Great Lakes region of Canada and the United States. It extends west from the Great Lakes to Manitoba, Minnesota and beyond. Approximately two hundred members of the First Nation live on the Wabigoon reservation and another two hundred live in the local area and they participate in its economic and cultural life. The formal leadership of the community is through Chief and Council. Chief and Council are determined by vote of community members.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The ancient presence of Wabigoon Lake Ojibway Nation people on their land is reflected in its vast forests and countless lakes, rivers and streams. This landscape is in turn reflected in them in their language, culture and way of life. Extensive fields of Manomin (wild rice) were planted by the ancestors and now form an abundant source of food for people and animals. Vast towering stands of pine, birch, cedar and spruce, as well as blueberries and other foods, were nurtured by an extensive knowledge and practice of controlled burning. The homeland of Wabigoon people is an Ojibway cultural landscape.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The members of Wabigoon Lake Ojibway Nation are descendants of signatories of an Indian Treaty with the British Crown in Right of Canada that covers 55,000 square miles of land. Treaty #3 was signed in October of 1873.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Wabigoon Lake Ojibway Nation is rapidly becoming a native community with a vibrant renewed native cultural, social and economic life. Now emerging from a history of extreme hardship and privation, the First Nation has become a progressive force for renewal throughout the Treaty #3 region. The history of Wabigoon people includes the tragedy of demographic collapse that resulted from the ravages of sickness and disease that was brought to Canada by European explorers, missionaries, government officials and settlers. This was followed by systematic cultural suppression including the outlawing of their sacred religious ceremonies by the Government of Canada. This suppression by the Government of Canada was so pervasive that status Indians were not recognized as &quot;persons&quot; under Canadian law until 1960.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Even during their years of privation and hardship, Wabigoon Lake Ojibway Nation people were planting the seeds of their cultural and economic renewal. The Wabigoon Nation held fast to their traditional spirit of survival and enterprise. For example, when a dam was built by the settler forestry industry at Dryden in 1896, extensive fields of Manomin and hay pastures were flooded. Where Manomin fields were flooded the plant could grow no more. In response, Wabigoon people undertook a systematic program of taking Manomin from local lakes unaffected by the flooding and planting it into their hay pastures that were now under shallow water. The Manomin fields there today include some of the most extensive in the region. They are so ecologically as well as economically significant that they are now protected by the Government of Ontario. These Manomin fields support the only native wild rice processing plant in Canada - a facility built by Wabigoon people in 1988 and located on the Wabigoon reservation. In the late 1950\'s and early 1960\'s the Government of Ontario engaged in a systematic effort to develop and implement legislation that would have seen the alienation of most of the tribally held rice fields in the Treaty #3 into non-native hands. It was the Chief of Wabigoon, Chief Paul Pitchenese, who led the successful effort to prevent this from happening. Without this effort a native-owned wild rice processing plant would not exist on the Wabigoon reservation today.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The pro-active efforts of Wabigoon Lake Ojibway Nation towards economic self-determination have been applied in a variety of areas. Some members of Wabigoon are now fifth generation native Ojibway loggers. Even when an Indian Agent was unlawfully selling timber resources from the Wabigoon reservation a century ago (sales which have now given rise to a lawful land claim that is currently being resolved with the Government of Canada), Wabigoon people were fighting to participate fully in the regional forestry industry. Now the First Nation is home to the most successful native logging enterprise in Ontario. This enterprise is an integrated &quot;stump to dump&quot; operation where an Ojibway company does everything from building forest access roads to delivering wood that it harvests to regional mills. Wabigoon Lake Ojibway Nation has built on this success; it operates a successful tree nursery that now grows six million seedlings under contract with mainstream forestry companies. The community is currently expanding into a value-added forest products tribal enterprise venture.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The members of Wabigoon Lake Ojibway Nation have developed a progressive culture of tribal economic and cultural entrepreneurship. What is meant by cultural entrepreneurship? It is a pro-active approach to cultural renewal. For more than a century the cultural practices of the Ojibway people were suppressed in Canada. As already noted, their sacred ceremonies were outlawed. It was in the context of this legacy of discrimination that Wabigoon Lake Ojibway Nation became the first community in the Treaty #3 region to hold an open and public &quot;traditional powwow&quot;. This happened in the 1970\'s.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The economic and cultural renewal that can be readily seen taking place at Wabigoon Lake Ojibway Nation today is, in effect, the culmination of generations of work and preparation. The dividends of this effort are growing.

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Inspired by her children, world travels, and her own childhood, Charmaine Carlson uses both past and present experiences as her muse. Reaching into the past, she unearths nostalgic images, color palettes, typefaces and styles, which she then magically reinterprets in refreshingly modern ways.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>With an inclination toward the creative arts, Charmaine earned a degree in Fashion Design and Marketing, and spent 10 plus years working in the business before the corporate culture began to have her yearning for freer pastures.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>An infatuation with paper led to the creation of Yellow Bird Paper Greetings in 2002. Originally supplying a handful of North American retailers with handmade, hand-embellished greeting cards, that were celebrated for their combination of sass and sophistication, the demand for these chi-chi concoctions was exceptional. Not one to stand on her laurels, Charmaine channeled her creative talents and in 2004 launched an all new printed collection which consisted of 16 greeting cards. This launch ultimately led to the Yellow Bird Paper Greetings global recognition and the collection, as it stands today, of 1000 plus items.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Yellow Bird Paper Greetings hasn\'t flown too far from its\' beginnings. All of our products continue to be manufactured in North America. Using only the highest quality papers. We believe it\'s best to manufacture high-quality greeting cards and stationery products that benefit our friends, neighbors and the earth. In short, we strive to offer great products, great designs and great price points, all while still being mindful of the environment. Nestled in the foot hills of North Vancouver, British Columbia Yellow Bird Paper Greetings is still headed by its founder Charmaine Carlson. Anyone visiting the office should be prepared to be greeted with licks and wags from Charmaine\'s yellow lab Ruby who is a permanent fixture in the office and never let\'s Charmaine get too far from her gaze.</div>','company_name' => 'Yellow Bird Paper Greetings Inc','company_email' => 'info@yellowbirdgreetings.com','address' => '2930 Lonsdale Ave','url' => 'www.yellowbirdgreetings.com ','phone' => '(604) 980-8215','fax' => '(604) 980-8217','key_words' => '','logo' => '1705.jpeg','video' => '','facebook' => NULL,'twitter' => NULL,'linked_in' => NULL,'youtube' => NULL,'google' => NULL,'image_1' => NULL,'image_2' => NULL,'image_3' => NULL,'image_4' => NULL),

<div>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not so much about what we know, which is a lot, but more about what we can figure out&rdquo; This quote from President Michael Zuraw sums up the attitude of Zuraw Technologies.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&ldquo;When a request for quote comes in and it is something out side of the normal type of parts we do, the first thing I do is ask our platers &lsquo;how can we get this done&rsquo;.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The Team at Zuraw Technologies has been very successful in accommodating all types of customer requests. We have been able to salvage a variety of very large parts that have been miss-machined and would otherwise have been scrapped saving our customers tens of thousands of dollars.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>When other platers tell you they can&rsquo;t do the job or it can&rsquo;t be done at all, Zuraw Technologies finds a way.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We have experience servicing the needs of many industries, but in particular:</div>
<div>Plastic Injection molding, including PET preforms processing</div>
<div>Aerospace components</div>
<div>Oil and Gas/Chemical Processing pipe and fittings</div>
<div>Valves</div>
<div>Power generation components</div>
<div>In the spring of 2012 we acquired and now operate Metalon Technologies</div>','company_name' => 'Zuraw Technologies Inc','company_email' => 'info@zurawtech.ca','address' => '1-125 McDonald Blvd','url' => 'zurawtech.ca ','phone' => '(519) 853-0249','fax' => '(519) 853-4664','key_words' => '','logo' => '1747.jpeg','video' => '','facebook' => NULL,'twitter' => NULL,'linked_in' => NULL,'youtube' => NULL,'google' => NULL,'image_1' => NULL,'image_2' => NULL,'image_3' => NULL,'image_4' => NULL),

CAST\'s clients are armed with  the tools and confidence to perform to the highest standards. CAST\'s  1988 launch marked the creation and delivery of a specialized training  program for municipal fire fighters whose area of responsibility  included airports. CAST reshaped conventional wisdom by originating a  revolutionary program designed to meet this crucial safety need, not  only more economically, but also more efficiently, by employing existing  municipal structural fire fighting personnel, equipment, expertise and  experience. CAST its growth through developing, auditing and reviewing  emergency and security plans for airlines, airports, corporations, and  governments across Canada and worldwide. All plans, exercises and audits  have been tailored to meet the unique requirements of individual  clients.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="MsoNormal">When the U.S. government  introduced legislation which required all airlines to submit plans  under the Aviation Disaster Family Assistance Act (1996) and the Foreign  Air Carrier Family Support Act (1997), CAST developed comprehensive  plans to align its client airlines with their obligations to keep pace  with evolving American regulations.&nbsp; And CAST pioneered the concept of  gathering under one umbrella the expanding array of services that  airlines and other organizations are increasingly expected to marshal,  while preparing for or responding to incidents. In accordance with  heightening expectations of both regulators and the public, CAST  fashioned unprecedented response programs designed to harness and  coordinate all aspects of crisis response plans and procedures.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="MsoNormal">It was during this  development phase that CAST, together with Rural/Metro Corporation of  Arizona, founded the Emergency Measures Inquiry Center (EMIC) in  Scottsdale which led to the partnership\'s development of the world\'s  first major transportation emergency operation to combine under one  contract the three definitive components of complete emergency response:  preparedness, response, and long-term repatriation and disposition of  personal effects. This original EMIC prototype became the acknowledged  standard for other large-scale, worldwide systems, which were to follow  (In 2000, Rural/Metro acquired full ownership of EMIC while CAST  intensified its focus on further development of innovative safety and  security capabilities.).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="MsoNormal">CAST answered the call  from Bombardier Aerospace to provide project safety management for the  mammoth 2002 World Youth Day and 2003 SAR&rsquo;s benefit concert events held  at the company\'s Downsview airfield in Toronto. These were 2 of the  largest events of their kind in the world with the World Youth Day  hosting almost a million participants from around the globe. It was  CAST\'s responsibility to guide and coordinate such diverse tasks as  keeping the work of on-site construction crews in accordance with  Canada\'s Civil Aviation Regulations, red-flagging potential safety and  logistical hot spots during the event, and ensuring that post-event  cleanup and repairs returned the airfield promptly and safely to its  normal functions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="MsoNormal">Most recently CAST has  pioneered the development of a practical approach to aviation Safety  Management Systems. Based on extensive hands-on experience in a variety  of safety critical environments&nbsp; including developing SMS philosophies,  policies, procedures and practices for international airlines and other  complex organizations,&nbsp; CAST&rsquo;s approach to SMS is providing clients with  a simple, efficient and cost effective means of managing&nbsp; today&rsquo;s  evolving safety and emergency management environment.</p>','company_name' => 'CAST Safety Systems','company_email' => 'castsafety@gmail.com','address' => '362 Moffatt St','url' => 'www.castsafety.com/ ','phone' => '(613) 219-5129','fax' => '(613) 257-8395','key_words' => '','logo' => '1956.jpeg','video' => '','facebook' => NULL,'twitter' => NULL,'linked_in' => NULL,'youtube' => NULL,'google' => NULL,'image_1' => NULL,'image_2' => NULL,'image_3' => NULL,'image_4' => NULL),

<p style="text-align:justify" class="MsoNormal">Product Reliability: All  EPS used in packaging fabrication is UL approved and has fire retardant  additives incorporated at the time of manufacture.

There is limited  resistance to paraffin oil, vegetable oils, diesel fuel and Vaseline.  EPS must not be exposed to organic solvents such as hydrocarbons,  chlorinated hydrocarbons, ketones and esters. Note: If EPS is placed in  contact with materials or vapors of unknown composition, tests should be  made to determine compatibility.</p>

It offers high resistance to the passage of heat energy - it  is a very effective insulator. It is also economical, offering high  R-value per dollar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="MsoNormal">Expanded foams (EPS) are  commonly known as bead boards. The raw material is a small bead. These  are heated with steam and the softened plastic expands as the pentane  gas trapped in the plastic beads expands. These pre-expanding beads are  then cured during an aging process. The cured beads are than introduced  to a mold where further contact with steam softens and expands the beads  to fill the mold cavity and fuse the beads tightly together. The molded  foam can be in large rectangular blocks that are further processed by  cutting with hot wires into standard sized sheets or custom cut billets.  This is known as block molding. The basic EPS blocks are cut and shaped  to produce a variety of Truefoam sheet, board and panel products  including Truewall, Truefit, Foundation Plus/Sheathing, Insulwall, and  others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="MsoNormal">For certain Truefoam  products, such as Reward Wall ICFs and Styropack shipping containers,  the polystyrene is shape moulded during final expansion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="MsoNormal">EPS is structurally  rigid and stable, yet very light. It is very easy to cut and shape using  the simplest of tools. It produces no irritating fibres or annoying  dust. EPS products make the job quicker for both contractors and  do-it-yourselfers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="MsoNormal">EPS insulation doesn\'t  change or deteriorate over time. EPS sheets and panels cannot sag or  bunch. EPS insulation is unaffected by freeze-thaw cycles, and cannot  rot or mould. EPS insulation\'s R-value is permanent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="MsoNormal">EPS insulation is very  resistant to the passage of water, yet it &quot;breathes.&quot; Vapour passes  through. This avoids condensation buildup within walls, a serious  problem which can arise with other insulation systems. And because of  the rigid closed-cell structure of EPS, there is no possibility of the  kind of air movement inside the wall which can lead to heat loss in  loose or blanket materials.</p>','company_name' => 'Newfoundland Styro Inc.','company_email' => 'info@nfstyro.com','address' => '12 Dominic St.Industrial Pk.','url' => 'www.nfstyro.com ','phone' => '(709) 258-5890','fax' => '(709) 258-6015','key_words' => '','logo' => '2011.jpeg','video' => '','facebook' => NULL,'twitter' => NULL,'linked_in' => NULL,'youtube' => NULL,'google' => NULL,'image_1' => NULL,'image_2' => NULL,'image_3' => NULL,'image_4' => NULL),

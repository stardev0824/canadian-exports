John had a long history in the Electrical industry with Langley Electric which became Amalgamated Electric. John had apprenticed in Germany, and had a superb combination of electrical and mechanical skills. During this time he played a key role in the design of the Amalgamated Rotary handle switch from 30 Amperes to 1200 Amperes. This basic design is still manufactured today.  John had gone to work for Westinghouse as the head of a assembly shop to offer control panels and custom distribution equipment to local contractors. The shop was burdened by high overheads artificially imposed by the company and therefore appeared to Westinghouse to be unprofitable, in an accounting sense.</p>', ''),

Unlike petroleum based moisturizers, shea butter actually restores the skin\'s natural elasticity. Shea butter actually enables your skin to absorb moisture from the air, and as a result, it becomes softer and stays moisturized for longer. In addition, shea butter has natural sunscreen properties and anti-inflammatory agents. Because of its amazing properties, shea butter is an excellent ingredient for soaps, lotions and creams. Perhaps it is most effective when applied to the skin in its pure state. Regular users of pure, unrefined shea butter notice softer, smoother, healthier skin. Shea butter has also been shown to help with skin conditions and ailments such as extreme dryness, eczema, dermatitis, skin allergies, fungal infections, blemishes, wrinkles, stretch marks, scars, scrapes, and more.</p>', ''),

I had a degree in chemistry and a few years experience selling gas chromatography equipment.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">The commercial development of gas chromatography in the early \'60s was revolutionizing analytical chemistry, and at the same time, the publication of Rachel Carson\'s seminal book, &quot;Silent Spring&quot; had made society realize that nature was vulnerable to human intervention.&nbsp; She was talking about the indiscriminant use of DDT but the question soon became &quot;what contaminants are in the natural environment and food - and what harm are they doing to us?&quot;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">To get at that question, GC had become the analytical technique of choice, and it turned out that trace levels of contaminants were everywhere - including in the organic solvents that were available from laboratory supply houses at the time.&nbsp; This led to analysts distilling 4, 8, and even 20 litre batches of flammable solvents in glass vessels with electric heating mantles on their lab bench, to try to get the pure solvents they needed to avoid masking the contaminants of interest.&nbsp; I thought that was pretty inefficient and hazardous too.&nbsp; But I had my opportunity.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">There\'s an old story about Caledon having been started in a garden shed.&nbsp; That is only partly true.&nbsp; Mary Lou and I lived in a wooden house that was one hundred years old and we had two small children.&nbsp; I wasn\'t about to take the risk* of distilling anything in the cellar, so the garden shed was used for a series of small scale batches to see if I could get the required purity.&nbsp; The first real production occurred in the fall of 1972 in a 1,500 square foot building on rented land.&nbsp; By 1975 we had acquired industrial land in Georgetown and moved to a 4,500 square foot plant that was custom designed for the purification and packaging of organic solvents.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">So that\'s where we came from.&nbsp; How we got there is a story of taking one step at a time.&nbsp; As we refined our methods we added more solvents, and then chemicals, and then acids and solutions, and the plant was expanded again to the 24,000 square feet that we now occupy.&nbsp; But more important than those size and product additions are the people who took the steps to make the expansions happen.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">I have always believed that if you treat people well, they will treat you well in return.&nbsp; It is a simple truth that, in business, applies to customers, suppliers and employees.&nbsp; Early on, Caledon adopted and clearly communicated some core policies, a central one being to treat people with dignity and trust.&nbsp; Then, by their actions, the company and its managers did their utmost to give those policies substance.&nbsp; For more on this click on Management Philosophy.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">Caledon employees have responded in spades.&nbsp; The whole group - Sales and Customer Service, Marketing, Purchasing, Production, Accounting and Distribution - operates as a coordinated team in which individuals contribute that &quot;discretionary effort&quot; that we all have within ourselves, and can make available when we are motivated to do so.&nbsp; That is how we got here.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">And what of my favorite Uncle Arthur? He lived a long and productive life, and the store is now run by two of his grandchildren - the fifth generation of Brocks to do so.&nbsp; It is a fixture on the main street of Port Perry, Ontario, and is about to celebrate its 125th anniversary.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">&nbsp;</p>', ''),

John had a long history in the Electrical industry with Langley Electric which became Amalgamated Electric. John had apprenticed in Germany, and had a superb combination of electrical and mechanical skills. During this time he played a key role in the design of the Amalgamated Rotary handle switch from 30 Amperes to 1200 Amperes. This basic design is still manufactured today.  John had gone to work for Westinghouse as the head of a assembly shop to offer control panels and custom distribution equipment to local contractors. The shop was burdened by high overheads artificially imposed by the company and therefore appeared to Westinghouse to be unprofitable, in an accounting sense.</p>', ''),

Wood is a renewable, reusable, recyclable and biodegradable. Non-wood products require far more energy to manufacture than wood.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe supplies of ores and petroleum for the production of metal and plastic are finite and cause pollution of the air and water, contributing to global warming. One pound of wood grown in a vigorous younger forest removes 1.47 pounds of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and replaces it with 1.07 pounds of life-sustaining oxygen.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWood is also the best insulator of all structural building materials, with millions of tiny air cells trapped within its cellular structure providing a barrier against the heat and cold. An inch of wood is 15 times as efficient an insulator as concrete, 400 times as efficient as steel and 1770 times as efficient as aluminium. Homes built from wood require far less energy to heat and cool, thus conserving fossil fuels and coal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn a very real sense, wood products are the most environmentally responsible building material anyone could ever use. In addition, our manufacturing facility gathers all saw dust made from our equipment into a silo where a machine compresses the saw dust into firewood briquettes. These firewood briquettes are used to heat our manufacturing facility.We are proud of our \'special order\' association with many of North America\'s most reputable home improvement and millwork retailers. </p>', ''),

In 2003 and 2004 we acquired technical support and payment processing companies to broaden our scope of services into the general online subscription billing and automated payments space.<o:p></o:p></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:justify\">In 2007, the growth in Software as a Service (SaaS) and the cloud infrastructure markets was the catalyst for Monexa to take our already feature and function rich on-demand subscription billing and payments product and spend the next year on even more functionality and new user interfaces and billing language appropriate to these markets. In mid-2008, we launched our enhanced capabilities and priced them in such a way as to enable companies of any size to affordably obtain the same subscription billing and payments functionality as our large ISP and Telecom customers. Monexa continues to be the ground breaker in new online billing functionality with new releases every 6 to 8 weeks on top of what is already the most feature rich online billing application available.<o:p></o:p></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:justify\">Monexa was the first to offer an on-demand subscription billing and payments platform. Our technology has been a true multi-tenant, online billing solution from day one. 14 years of experience with sophisticated technology subscription customers has resulted in the most sophisticated product in the market and the most experienced team to guide your implementation.<o:p></o:p></p>', ''),

The raw material is a small bead. These are heated with steam and the softened plastic expands as the pentane gas trapped in the plastic beads expands. These pre-expanding beads are then cured during an aging process. The cured beads are than introduced to a mold where further contact with steam softens and expands the beads to fill the mold cavity and fuse the beads tightly together. The molded foam can be in large rectangular blocks that are further processed by cutting with hot wires into standard sized sheets or custom cut billets. This is known as block molding.

Increasingly thieves are targeting equipment and electronics on boats in marinas. Outboards and tenders are favourite targets as they are easily transported and even if secured with chains or locks, are rarely monitored by security systems or boat alarms.<o:p></o:p></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:justify\">Theft is not the only event that can cause the loss of a boat. Every year boats sink where they are moored in marinas. A failed through hull fitting can eventually overpower a bilge pump or cause the bilge pump to drain the battery and sink the boat.<o:p></o:p></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:justify\">The solution is to use a security system for your boat that monitors not only entry points on the boat, but also important status points such as bilge water level, battery voltage and even temperature. A boat alarm is not enough. A two-way remote monitoring system will keep you informed<o:p></o:p></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:justify\">For more information contact SilverTip Marine today!<o:p></o:p></p>', ''),

In accordance with heightening expectations of both regulators and the public, CAST fashioned unprecedented response programs designed to harness and coordinate all aspects of crisis response plans and procedures.<o:p></o:p></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:justify\">It was during this development phase that CAST, together with Rural/Metro Corporation of Arizona, founded the Emergency Measures Inquiry Center (EMIC) in Scottsdale which led to the partnership\'s development of the world\'s first major transportation emergency operation to combine under one contract the three definitive components of complete emergency response: preparedness, response, and long-term repatriation and disposition of personal effects. This original EMIC prototype became the acknowledged standard for other large-scale, worldwide systems, which were to follow (In 2000, Rural/Metro acquired full ownership of EMIC while CAST intensified its focus on further development of innovative safety and security capabilities.).<o:p></o:p></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:justify\">CAST answered the call from Bombardier Aerospace to provide project safety management for the mammoth 2002 World Youth Day and 2003 SAR&rsquo;s benefit concert events held at the company\'s Downsview airfield in Toronto. These were 2 of the largest events of their kind in the world with the World Youth Day hosting almost a million participants from around the globe. It was CAST\'s responsibility to guide and coordinate such diverse tasks as keeping the work of on-site construction crews in accordance with Canada\'s Civil Aviation Regulations, red-flagging potential safety and logistical hot spots during the event, and ensuring that post-event cleanup and repairs returned the airfield promptly and safely to its normal functions.<o:p></o:p></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:justify\">Most recently CAST has pioneered the development of a practical approach to aviation Safety Management Systems. Based on extensive hands-on experience in a variety of safety critical environments&nbsp; including developing SMS philosophies, policies, procedures and practices for international airlines and other complex organizations,&nbsp; CAST&rsquo;s approach to SMS is providing clients with a simple, efficient and cost effective means of managing&nbsp; today&rsquo;s evolving safety and emergency management environment.<o:p></o:p></p>', ''),

In fact, the word &ldquo;electricity&rdquo; comes from the Greek word for amber, elekton. &nbsp;It was observed that dust particles would hop onto amber after it had been rubbed. &nbsp;That magical force was called electricity. &nbsp;The first electrically-enhanced air filters date back to 1930 and combine elements of both passive and electrostatic filtration. As with most high-efficiency filtration products, polarized media had its roots in industrial applications. Although there have been a number of different configurations since then, all are based on charging, or polarizing, fibers in a media and particles in the air in order to generate an electric force between the fibers and particles. While the principle has been around for many decades, it has only been in recent years that the technology has been fully understood to maximize effectiveness and to provide consistent, reliable performance.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>In 1982, two university professors from Carleton University in Ontario, Canada developed a polarized media design for a residential application that provided a simple means of replacing dirty media. They started Engineering Dynamics, Ltd. (EDL) and began manufacturing 1&rdquo; and 2&rdquo; polarized-media air cleaners, room console units and overhead ceiling-mount units, all under the Dynamic brand. All of the polarized-media air cleaners on the market today can be traced back to beginnings at EDL, although subsequent patents and refinements have created discernable differences in the product designs and features.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>In 1993, EDL was acquired by Environmental Dynamics Group, one of EDL&rsquo;s largest distributors. &nbsp;The companies are now known as Dynamic Air Quality Solutions. &nbsp;The primary manufacturing remains in Carleton Place, Ontario, while sales and engineering are based in the Princeton, New Jersey headquarters. &nbsp; While EDL&rsquo;s initial focus was primarily residential, Dynamic has also worked to address the clear need for improved air quality and energy savings in commercial and industrial applications. This has resulted in a focus on technology enhancements, new configurations, and a complete line of commercial products that now dominate in some categories, with healthcare and energy retrofits being the two largest business segments.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Dynamic has doubled sales every few years, invests heavily in research and product development and has a variety of patents in the field.</div>', ''),

Our clients range from several of the largest most recognizable names in the grocery and foodservice segments right thru to those beautifully unique individual owner/operator restaurants in your neighbourhood.</p>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>GBS was initially a manufacturer of rotisserie equipment supplying large and small grocers in the Ontario market. In the spring of 2001 the company was purchased by the Douglas Group of Companies and Mr. Paul Douglas, the primary shareholder of the Douglas Group. Mr. Douglas immediately set on the task of improving all aspects of sales, service and support by expanding the GBS product lines and re-investing in staff and support technology. This re-investment took the GBS product line from four items to the current 200+, and it allowed the company to offer more products and services to an ever growing list of customers. GBS has built a solid group of highly trained service technicians to support their growth, so a customer making a purchase in Toronto, St. Johns, or Vancouver knows they will receive the same great service right across the country.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>In 2003 GBS made its first substantial sales foray into Quebec, moving into the Maritime provinces in &rsquo;05 and into western Canada in 06. Mr. Douglas and his team of professionals now support hundreds and hundreds of customers across Canada, ranging from some of the largest multi unit operators in the country right down to the small single unit restaurant on your local corner. What has allowed GBS to grow over the past several years is their published motto/mission statement &ldquo;the Foodservice Company with the emphasis on SERVICE&rdquo;! &nbsp;GBS treats each and every client the way they expect, their business is the MOST important. This is only been achievable due to the commitment and experience of the entire GBS team.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>In addition to a backbone of traditional type equipment, rotisseries or fryers for example, GBS offers a wide range of unique, energy or labour saving equipment. In the current line-up GBS boasts five &ldquo;KI Award&rdquo; (Kitchen Innovations) winning products &ndash; truly offering existing or future clients some of the most innovate equipment opportunities in the marketplace. The GBS team, and Paul Douglas in particular, search the world looking for solutions to common commercial cooking issues thus ensuring that if it&rsquo;s new, if it&rsquo;s unique and if it&rsquo;s going to solve an issue GBS is likely the place to look.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>As we move into 2014 the focus of everyone at GBS continues to be customer service and satisfaction.

The rapid growth of VMAC has caused a workforce expansion to approximately 100 full and part-time employees, all highly trained in their important roles at VMAC.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Company History</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>The company was founded in Kitchener, Ontario, when two school friends, Tony Menard and Jim Hogan, decided that their entrepreneurial ideas required additional working capital. So, they decided to open their own machine shop. On August 8, 1986, VMAC (Vehicle Mounted Air Compressors) was incorporated under the name of Mangonel Corporation.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>By 1988, VMAC had become specialized in the manufacture of UNDERHOOD mounting brackets for truck-mounted air compressors. In 1990, Tony moved the company to his native hometown, Nanaimo, British Columbia. Jim had decided to stay in Ontario instead of moving with Tony but four years later, he rejoined the business.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>By 1996, the company had designed and introduced an electronic throttle control to complement its product range. VMAC Throttle Commander products are currently used on most popular light-duty work trucks for the construction, tire service truck, utility, emergency equipment, mining, forestry, and agriculture industries.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Beginning in 1997, Tony realized that reciprocating compressors UNDERHOOD would not be viable in future aerodynamic truck designs. In September 1997, VMAC introduced a new mobile air solution that would revolutionize the industry &ndash; the UNDERHOOD VR7000 (a.k.a. VR70) rotary screw air compressor system.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>VMAC continued to expand its VR70 and Throttle Commander product base over the next few years. And in 2002, VMAC once again amazed the mobile compressed air industry by introducing the VR150, doubling the output of the VR70 while remaining UNDERHOOD. The power of this unit allowed VMAC to compete with tow-behind portable air compressors.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Several years ago Lincoln Electric, a leader in welding system manufacturing, approached VMAC to build a product that would compliment a welder application to meet the needs of its customers. After some initial evaluation, the Research and Design Department at VMAC took the project on and introduced a product that worked directly with the Lincoln system. The Air Vantage 500 combined the functions of a Welder, Generator and Air Compressor. This product design helped VMAC make advances in other product developments.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>In 2004, VMAC set out on an aggressive customer-focused research campaign, to find its next great product line. Utilizing the knowledge gained from the research and experience gained from manufacturing UNDERHOOD Air Compressor systems for ten years, VMAC developed the world&rsquo;s lightest and smallest above deck hydraulic powered air compressor system. The powerful PREDATAIR60 Hydraulic Air Compressor System took VMAC from a niche supplier of UNDERHOOD Air Compressor Systems to a supplier in a mainstream market whereby many companies compete for market share. The launch in 2005 was one of the most exciting launches VMAC has ever seen.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>In July 2010, VMAC was deeply saddened by the loss of president Tony Menard in an accident. Jim Hogan took over as president of the company, which rallied to carry on the founder&rsquo;s vision.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>About Our Company Founder</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>VMAC continues to deliver application solutions to a broad spectrum of the market and is encouraged that other manufactures are following their lead in the area of UNDERHOOD technology.

The literature review of lifecycle assessment of wind, nuclear and natural gas generation claims that emissions from wind and nuclear are similar, with the exception of GHG emissions where wind produces &ldquo;distinctly less&rdquo; emissions than nuclear. The nuclear study claims that nuclear can be less GHG intensive than a scenario where wind and natural gas jointly generate power. The Canadian Wind Energy Association says wind can partner with hydroelectric, solar or energy storage and DSM technologies and, &ldquo;by choosing to focus on only one scenario, the study failed to consider a broad range of equally or more plausible scenarios for the future evolution of Canada\'s electricity grid.&rdquo; GHG emissions must be &ldquo;an increasingly important consideration in the selection of future sources&rdquo; of electricity, but CanWEA adds that the cost-competitiveness of new generation sources and their overall environmental performance and economic benefits are also important. Wind is cheaper than new nuclear reactors and is cost-competitive with new hydroelectric facilities, and is not subject to commodity and carbon price risks facing natural gas.</p>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>2014-10-21 (canadian association for renewable energies) The 140 MW solar PV facility in Kingston was one of the top asset finance transactions of the third quarter of this year, at $525 million, according the latest &lsquo;Global Trends in Clean Energy Investment&rsquo; produced by Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Total investment in Canada was $1.9 billion in Q3, up from $1.3 bn in Q2, and compares with $7.3 bn in the US, down from $10.7 bn in Q2 but up from $5.7 bn in Q3 of last year. Global investment in renewables totalled $175 bn in the first three quarters of 2014 &ldquo;as the sector shows signs of a worldwide recovery after a two-year slump,&rdquo; with most of the increase in China and Japan. Support fell to an eight-year low in Europe. &ldquo;There is no room for complacency because clean energy investment of between $200 bn and $300 bn a year is not large enough to herald the rapid transformation of the power system that experts say is required if the world is to see a peak in CO2 emissions around 2020,&rdquo; the report notes.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>', ''),

The five hundred members of Wabigoon belong to the great Ojibway Nation of the Great Lakes region of Canada and the United States. It extends west from the Great Lakes to Manitoba, Minnesota and beyond. Approximately two hundred members of the First Nation live on the Wabigoon reservation and another two hundred live in the local area and they participate in its economic and cultural life. The formal leadership of the community is through Chief and Council. Chief and Council are determined by vote of community members.</p>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>The ancient presence of Wabigoon Lake Ojibway Nation people on their land is reflected in its vast forests and countless lakes, rivers and streams. This landscape is in turn reflected in them in their language, culture and way of life. Extensive fields of Manomin (wild rice) were planted by the ancestors and now form an abundant source of food for people and animals. Vast towering stands of pine, birch, cedar and spruce, as well as blueberries and other foods, were nurtured by an extensive knowledge and practice of controlled burning. The homeland of Wabigoon people is an Ojibway cultural landscape.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>The members of Wabigoon Lake Ojibway Nation are descendants of signatories of an Indian Treaty with the British Crown in Right of Canada that covers 55,000 square miles of land. Treaty #3 was signed in October of 1873.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Wabigoon Lake Ojibway Nation is rapidly becoming a native community with a vibrant renewed native cultural, social and economic life. Now emerging from a history of extreme hardship and privation, the First Nation has become a progressive force for renewal throughout the Treaty #3 region. The history of Wabigoon people includes the tragedy of demographic collapse that resulted from the ravages of sickness and disease that was brought to Canada by European explorers, missionaries, government officials and settlers. This was followed by systematic cultural suppression including the outlawing of their sacred religious ceremonies by the Government of Canada. This suppression by the Government of Canada was so pervasive that status Indians were not recognized as &quot;persons&quot; under Canadian law until 1960.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Even during their years of privation and hardship, Wabigoon Lake Ojibway Nation people were planting the seeds of their cultural and economic renewal. The Wabigoon Nation held fast to their traditional spirit of survival and enterprise. For example, when a dam was built by the settler forestry industry at Dryden in 1896, extensive fields of Manomin and hay pastures were flooded. Where Manomin fields were flooded the plant could grow no more. In response, Wabigoon people undertook a systematic program of taking Manomin from local lakes unaffected by the flooding and planting it into their hay pastures that were now under shallow water. The Manomin fields there today include some of the most extensive in the region. They are so ecologically as well as economically significant that they are now protected by the Government of Ontario. These Manomin fields support the only native wild rice processing plant in Canada - a facility built by Wabigoon people in 1988 and located on the Wabigoon reservation. In the late 1950\'s and early 1960\'s the Government of Ontario engaged in a systematic effort to develop and implement legislation that would have seen the alienation of most of the tribally held rice fields in the Treaty #3 into non-native hands. It was the Chief of Wabigoon, Chief Paul Pitchenese, who led the successful effort to prevent this from happening. Without this effort a native-owned wild rice processing plant would not exist on the Wabigoon reservation today.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>The pro-active efforts of Wabigoon Lake Ojibway Nation towards economic self-determination have been applied in a variety of areas. Some members of Wabigoon are now fifth generation native Ojibway loggers. Even when an Indian Agent was unlawfully selling timber resources from the Wabigoon reservation a century ago (sales which have now given rise to a lawful land claim that is currently being resolved with the Government of Canada), Wabigoon people were fighting to participate fully in the regional forestry industry. Now the First Nation is home to the most successful native logging enterprise in Ontario. This enterprise is an integrated &quot;stump to dump&quot; operation where an Ojibway company does everything from building forest access roads to delivering wood that it harvests to regional mills. Wabigoon Lake Ojibway Nation has built on this success; it operates a successful tree nursery that now grows six million seedlings under contract with mainstream forestry companies. The community is currently expanding into a value-added forest products tribal enterprise venture.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>The members of Wabigoon Lake Ojibway Nation have developed a progressive culture of tribal economic and cultural entrepreneurship. What is meant by cultural entrepreneurship? It is a pro-active approach to cultural renewal. For more than a century the cultural practices of the Ojibway people were suppressed in Canada. As already noted, their sacred ceremonies were outlawed. It was in the context of this legacy of discrimination that Wabigoon Lake Ojibway Nation became the first community in the Treaty #3 region to hold an open and public &quot;traditional powwow&quot;. This happened in the 1970\'s.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>The economic and cultural renewal that can be readily seen taking place at Wabigoon Lake Ojibway Nation today is, in effect, the culmination of generations of work and preparation. The dividends of this effort are growing. For example, the wild rice processing plant on the Wabigoon', ''),

In accordance with  heightening expectations of both regulators and the public, CAST  fashioned unprecedented response programs designed to harness and  coordinate all aspects of crisis response plans and procedures.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\" class=\"MsoNormal\">It was during this  development phase that CAST, together with Rural/Metro Corporation of  Arizona, founded the Emergency Measures Inquiry Center (EMIC) in  Scottsdale which led to the partnership\'s development of the world\'s  first major transportation emergency operation to combine under one  contract the three definitive components of complete emergency response:  preparedness, response, and long-term repatriation and disposition of  personal effects. This original EMIC prototype became the acknowledged  standard for other large-scale, worldwide systems, which were to follow  (In 2000, Rural/Metro acquired full ownership of EMIC while CAST  intensified its focus on further development of innovative safety and  security capabilities.).</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\" class=\"MsoNormal\">CAST answered the call  from Bombardier Aerospace to provide project safety management for the  mammoth 2002 World Youth Day and 2003 SAR&rsquo;s benefit concert events held  at the company\'s Downsview airfield in Toronto.

It offers high resistance to the passage of heat energy - it  is a very effective insulator. It is also economical, offering high  R-value per dollar.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\" class=\"MsoNormal\">Expanded foams (EPS) are  commonly known as bead boards. The raw material is a small bead. These  are heated with steam and the softened plastic expands as the pentane  gas trapped in the plastic beads expands. These pre-expanding beads are  then cured during an aging process. The cured beads are than introduced  to a mold where further contact with steam softens and expands the beads  to fill the mold cavity and fuse the beads tightly together. The molded  foam can be in large rectangular blocks that are further processed by  cutting with hot wires into standard sized sheets or custom cut billets.  This is known as block molding. The basic EPS blocks are cut and shaped  to produce a variety of Truefoam sheet, board and panel products  including Truewall, Truefit, Foundation Plus/Sheathing, Insulwall, and  others.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\" class=\"MsoNormal\">For certain Truefoam  products, such as Reward Wall ICFs and Styropack shipping containers,  the polystyrene is shape moulded during final expansion.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\" class=\"MsoNormal\">EPS is structurally  rigid and stable, yet very light. It is very easy to cut and shape using  the simplest of tools. It produces no irritating fibres or annoying  dust. EPS products make the job quicker for both contractors and  do-it-yourselfers.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\" class=\"MsoNormal\">EPS insulation doesn\'t  change or deteriorate over time. EPS sheets and panels cannot sag or  bunch. EPS insulation is unaffected by freeze-thaw cycles, and cannot  rot or mould. EPS insulation\'s R-value is permanent.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\" class=\"MsoNormal\">EPS insulation is very  resistant to the passage of water, yet it &quot;breathes.&quot; Vapour passes  through. This avoids condensation buildup within walls, a serious  problem which can arise with other insulation systems. And because of  the rigid closed-cell structure of EPS, there is no possibility of the  kind of air movement inside the wall which can lead to heat loss in  loose or blanket materials.</p>', ''),

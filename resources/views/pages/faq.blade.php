            <p class="text-justify" style="line-height: 30px;">

            <p class="text-justify" style="line-height: 30px;">

            <h5 class="text-blue">Q12- Is Canadian Exports an Online Business Directory? If not, how is it different?</h5>
            <p class="text-justify" style="line-height: 30px;">
                A12: No. We have our own Online Business Directory, which contains more than 1.2 million Canadian businesses and is offered for free. The main differences between Canadian Exports and an Online Business Directory are:<br>

                1-  Canadian Exports advertises less than 300 businesses per issue, whereas a “Business Directory” contains millions. Advertising with us therefore allows you to stand out in the marketplace.<br>

                2-  Canadian Exports contains only exporters (unlike a “Business Directory”, which contains any and every business).<br>

                3-  Canadian Exports is a safe, secure and reliable way of breaking into new markets and/or increasing market share for companies around the world.<br>

                4-  Canadian Exports is always travelling the globe in search of new markets, opportunities and buyers. In comparison, a “Business Directory” is simply a static online tool, a passive online resource.
